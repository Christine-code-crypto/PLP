#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. What is software engineering and why is it important in the technology industry?
   Answer:
   Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It ensures that software is built efficiently, is reliable, scalable, and meets user requirements. In the tech industry, software engineering is crucial because it supports the creation of high-quality applications that power everything from mobile apps to enterprise systems and critical infrastructure.

2. What are three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering?
   Answer:

1950s-60s: Birth of Programming Languages – High-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were developed, making programming more accessible.

1970s: Structured Programming & Waterfall Model – Emphasized clear structure and the introduction of formal SDLC models like Waterfall.

2001: Agile Manifesto – Revolutionized development by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.

3. What are the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
   Answer:

Requirement Analysis: Understanding user needs.

System Design: Defining system architecture and design.

Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code.

Testing: Checking for bugs and verifying functionality.

Deployment: Releasing the software to users.

Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues post-deployment.

4. How do Waterfall and Agile methodologies differ? When is each appropriate?
   Answer:

Waterfall: Linear, sequential approach. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Best for: Projects with clear, unchanging requirements (e.g., government systems).

Agile: Iterative, flexible approach with frequent reassessments and updates.

Best for: Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., mobile app development).

5. What are the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, QA Engineer, and Project Manager?
   Answer:

Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, collaborates with team, and implements features.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Designs and executes test cases, reports bugs, ensures software quality.

Project Manager: Plans timelines, manages resources, coordinates team activities, and ensures project goals are met.

6. Why are IDEs and Version Control Systems important? Provide examples.
   Answer:

IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm): Provide code editing, debugging, and building tools in one place, boosting productivity.

VCS (e.g., Git, GitHub): Track code changes, support collaboration, and allow rollback if needed—critical for teamwork and project history.

7. What are common challenges faced by software engineers and how can they overcome them?
   Answer:

Challenge: Debugging complex issues
Solution: Use debugging tools and collaborate with peers

Challenge: Meeting deadlines
Solution: Use Agile practices and time management tools

Challenge: Communication gaps
Solution: Daily stand-ups and clear documentation

8. What are the types of testing and why are they important?
   Answer:

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions.

Integration Testing: Tests how modules interact together.

System Testing: Validates the complete system as a whole.

Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery.
Testing ensures the software is functional, reliable, and meets user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. What is prompt engineering and why is it important when working with AI models?
   Answer:
   Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to communicate clearly with AI systems to get accurate and relevant outputs. It is important because the quality of the prompt directly impacts the usefulness and accuracy of the AI's response.

2. Give an example of a vague prompt and improve it. Explain the difference.
   Question:
   What is an example of a vague prompt, and how can it be improved to be more effective?

Answer:

Vague Prompt: “Tell me something about history.”

Improved Prompt: “Give me a brief summary of the causes and effects of World War II in Europe.”

Why it’s better: The improved prompt is specific (focuses on WWII), clear (asks for causes and effects), and concise, guiding the AI to provide a more relevant and informative answer.
